Brief Description:
Mindspark is an all in one mental wellbeing hub that promotes mental health care to all. Users are able to record daily journal entries and log their moods along with it. There is also a calendar view that allows users to access previous journal entries and see general mood trends over longer periods of time. Furthermore, we added a "quests" page that provides users with fun tasks that are often associated with alleviating stress and improving mental states, which users are encouraged to do to improve their day!
